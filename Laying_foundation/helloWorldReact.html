<!-- what do we need to configure our project with react?

Browsers understands the javascript code but it doesnot understand react code .
Browsers dont undertsand react and neither our poject is configured with react.
To configure react into our project we can import CDN. -->

<!-- what is CDN ?
This is content dilevery network. These are the websites where react has been hosted
 -->
 <!-- we put react into our project using CDN links  -->
 

 <!-- why do we use CDN links for our project?
 CDN links are essential for several reasons:
  Faster Load Times: CDN servers are optimized 
  for quick content delivery, reducing the time it 
  takes for web pages to load -->

  <!-- In ReactJS, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing or CORS 
  requests refers to the method that allows you to 
  make requests to the server deployed at a different
   domain. As a reference, if the frontend and backend
 are at two different domains, we need CORS there. -->
